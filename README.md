Design
Colour Scheme
The two main colours used on the site are blue and white.
Typography
The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.
Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

FEATURES:
components
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z.
- For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files
that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

- In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented
in the future:

Technologies Used
Languages Used
- HTML5
  HTML 5 was the main language used and was appropriate because it provided the website with semantic elements, giving each section a meaningful name,
  such as nav, section and footer to easily define.
- CSS3

Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
Bootstrap 4.5
BootStrap
Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier
making the site responsive on mobile devices.
Hover.css:
Hover.css was used added in the head tag. This was for implementing cool looking hover effects when hovering over links.
This feature was not used but was a nice addition for future edits.
Google Fonts:
Google fonts were used to import the 'Epilgue' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
jQuery:
jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive in Javascript.
Git
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal and initialising commands.
GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being commited from Gitpod.
Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.


TESTING:
You believe the site works well.
- go over your user stories from your ux section and ensure they all work as intended, with the 
project providing an easy and straight forward way for your users to achieve their goals.
- test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

- Also test screen sizes on different browsers.

- Talk about any bug or problems

DEPLOYMENT:
- Describe the process you went through to deploy the project to GitHub.

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
