Brief Introduction to the Project

The purpose of this website is to broadcast my skills, information and work history to potential employers and recruiters.
They have a need for IT and viewing this website they can gather clear and defined amount of information.

UX
User Stories
- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn more about the developer.

- As a first time user I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and efficient way without any complex design.


- As a Recruiter I want to be able to use an array of socials as a way of understanding how trusted and known the individual is.
  I also want to know that I can use another form of communication with them if there are any job updates that match there skills.

- As a first time user I want to be able to read information about the individual in a clear and concise way, with appropriate font and paragraphs
  formatted in a consistent way on the page.

- As a Recruiter/Employer I would want to be able to see the developers CV and have a way of downloading it to my computer so I can keep on file.

- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to be able to contact the developer if I am interested in the individuals work and skill set.


Design
Colour Scheme
The two main colours used on the site are blue and white. Using a dark and white color together contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.
Typography
The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

BootStrap
Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier
making the site responsive on mobile devices.
Hover.css:
Hover.css was used added in the head tag. This was for implementing cool looking hover effects when hovering over links.
This feature was not used but was a nice addition for future edits.
Google Fonts:
Google fonts were used to import the 'Epilgue' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
jQuery:
jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive in Javascript.
Git
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal and initialising commands.
GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being commited from Gitpod.
Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.


Testing
The W3C Markup Validator was a feature used to validate all html elements on each page.
the W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate was used to validate every snippet of css in the style sheet
these were both used to prevent mistakes and would run snytax errors if there was something wrong.

Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
First Time Visitor Goals
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand main concept of the site and learn more about the developer.
  i. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable bootstrap navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a an Image of the developers face with Text "About Me".
  i. The main points are made immediately with the image and the 'About me' header which is nicely centered and bold.
     The user now knows the site is about the developer, and gets a nice warm feeling like there smiling back at them to encourage them to read more information on the page.

- As a first time user I want to be able to navigate the site in an easy and effient way without any complex design.
  i. The overall design has been made to be fluid with a navigation bar with clear defined links to each page.
  i. On the Contact Page when the form has been submitted the page will refresh and take the user back to the top of the page.

- As a first time user I want to be able to read information about the individual in a clear and concise way, with appropriate font and paragraphs
  formatted in a consistent way on the page.

Further Testing
The wesbite was tested on multiple browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and FireFox, but the main one that was used chrome. This was because it was using the chrome extension at the time for gitpod
and felt chrome was fast and reliable.
The website was viewed on iPhone SE, Android and laptop. There was also use of the developer tools as a faster way to look at the site becoming responisve suhc as using the example devices in th etools area.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
