Brief Introduction to the Project

This project is a development from Richard Jones and the purpose of this
website is to broadcast my skills , information and work history to potential employers and recruiters.
The wesbite includes Information about me and why i would be suitable in becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.

UX
SCOPE, STRUCTURE, 
who is this wesbite for.
what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

user stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general
structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

Links to wireframes- included as a pdf file in the directory

FEATURES:
components
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z.
- For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files
that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

- In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented
in the future:

TECHNOLOGIES:
- languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project.
For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.
- HTML 5 
HTML 5 was the mian language used and was appropriate because it provided the website with semantic elements, giving each section a meaningful name, such as nav, section and footer to easily define.
- BootStrap
  Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier on myself
  making the site responsive on mobile devices.


TESTING:
You believe the site works well.
- go over your user stories from your ux section and ensure they all work as intended, with the 
project providing an easy and straight forward way for your users to achieve their goals.
- test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

- Also test screen sizes on different browsers.

- Talk about any bug or problems

DEPLOYMENT:
- Describe the process you went through to deploy the project to GitHub.

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
