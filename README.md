Rick's Website

Brief Introduction to the Project

The purpose of this website is to broadcast my skills, information and work history to potential employers and recruiters.
They have a need for IT and viewing this website they can gather clear and defined amount of information.

UX
User Stories
- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to understand the main concept of the site and learn more about the developer.

- As a Recruiter I want to be able to use an array of socials as a way of understanding how trusted and known the individual is.
  I also want to know that I can use another form of communication with them if there are any job updates that match there skills.

- As a First time user I want to be able to read information about the individual in a clear and concise way, with appropriate font and paragraphs
  formatted in a consistent way on the page.

- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to be able to contact the developer if I am interested in the individuals work and skill set.


Design
1. Colour Scheme
- The two main colours used on the site are blue and white. Using a dark and white color together contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.
2. Typography
- The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

     b. The main points are made immediately with the image and the 'About me' header which is nicely centered and bold.
     The user now knows the site is about the developer, and gets a nice warm feeling like there smiling back at them to encourage them to read more information on the page.

Further Testing
- The website was tested on multiple browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and FireFox, but the main one that was used chrome. This was because it was using the chrome extension at the time for gitpod
and felt chrome was fast and reliable.

- The website was viewed on iPhone SE, Android and laptop. There was also use of the developer tools as a faster way to look at the site becoming responisve suhc as using the example devices in th etools area.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
